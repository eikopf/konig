# Zigzag

A Rust-based chess engine, built to support custom implementations and chess variants.


## Usage
`TODO`

## Notes
This project was previously implemented in Zig (hence the name), but I ultimately felt that the state of the Zig ecosystem was too spartan for a large project, and I feel much more able to complete the project in Rust.
