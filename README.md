# Konig
> Oder `koenig`? Wei√ü ich nicht.

A Rust-based chess engine, built to support custom implementations and chess variants. In general, it should be just as easy to implement standard chess, hex chess, or an infinite chess board with the traits and definitions in this crate.

## Top-level `TODO`s for `v0.2.0`
- [x] Implement FEN string processing.
- [x] Implement SAN literal processing.
- [x] Finalize definitions in `konig::core`.
- [ ] `konig::standard`
  - An implementation of standard chess using `konig::core`.
  - [ ] Move validation.
  - [ ] Move processing.
  - [ ] Display implementation.
  - [ ] Significant testing.
  - [ ] Complete and review documentation.

## Usage
`TODO`, i.e., DON'T USE THIS LIBRARY YET.

It's still very unfinished; I expect usage of this crate to be reasonable by the release of `v0.2.0`.
